# Awesome Service Workers ðŸ“¡

> Useful resources for working with Service Workers

> Service Workers are the backbone for creating [offline-first](http://offlinefirst.org/) applications. They sit, conceptually, between the network and the document, giving them the ability to intercept the network requests and provide content for documents, even while offline.

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing.

## Specification

The problem of offline -

> Web Applications traditionally assume that the network is reachable ... HTML documents are loaded over HTTP and traditionally fetch all of their sub-resources via subsequent HTTP requests. This places web content at a disadvantage versus other technology stacks.

The solution -

> The service worker is designed first to redress this balance by providing a Web Worker context, which can be started by a runtime when navigations are about to occur. This event-driven worker is registered against an origin and a path (or pattern), meaning it can be consulted when navigations occur to that location. **Events that correspond to network requests are dispatched to the worker and the responses generated by the worker may over-ride default network stack behavior**. This puts the service worker, conceptually, between the network and a document renderer, allowing the service worker to provide content for documents, even while offline.

## How Tos

### Register a Service Worker


```
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw-test/sw.js', { scope: '/sw-test/' }).then(function(reg) {
    // registration worked
    console.log('Registration succeeded. Scope is ' + reg.scope);
  }).catch(function(error) {
    // registration failed
    console.log('Registration failed with ' + error);
  });
}
```

### Install a Service Worker

```
self.addEventListener('install', function() {
	event.waitUntil(
		// Promise
	)
});
```
